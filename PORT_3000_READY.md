# ✅ Your App is Running on Port 3000!

## 🚀 Server Status

```
✓ Next.js 14.2.3
✓ Local: http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 3.3s
✓ Environment: .env.local loaded
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Google OAuth

### **1. Open Login Page**
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

**What you should see:**
- ✅ Email/password fields
- ✅ "Or continue with" divider
- ✅ Three OAuth buttons: GitHub, Google, Microsoft
- ✅ Google button with official colors (blue, red, yellow, green)

---

### **2. Open Signup Page**
```
http://localhost:3000/signup
```

**What you should see:**
- ✅ Full name, email, password fields
- ✅ "Or sign up with" divider
- ✅ Same three OAuth buttons
- ✅ Google button styled and ready

---

### **3. Test Google Button (Before OAuth Configured)**

**Click the Google button:**

**Expected behavior:**
1. ✅ Button shows spinner animation
2. ✅ Button becomes disabled (grayed out)
3. ✅ After a moment, you'll see an error message:
   ```
   ❌ Failed to sign in with google. Please try again.
   ```
4. ✅ This is NORMAL - you haven't configured OAuth credentials yet!

**This proves:**
- ✅ Code is working
- ✅ Error handling is working
- ✅ Loading states are working
- ✅ User feedback is working

---

## ⚙️ Configure Google OAuth (Next Step)

To make the button actually work and sign you in:

### **Quick Setup (10 minutes):**

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/
   ```

2. **Create OAuth Credentials**
   - Follow: `docs/setup/GOOGLE_OAUTH_QUICKSTART.md`
   - Get: Client ID and Client Secret

3. **Important: Add Both Redirect URIs**
   
   In Google Console, add these **two** redirect URIs:
   
   ```
   https://kgpctabhtsrrdyxetawz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```
   
   **Why two?**
   - First one: For production (Supabase hosted)
   - Second one: For local testing (your dev server)

4. **Add to Supabase**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google
   - Enable: ON
   - Client ID: (paste from Google)
   - Client Secret: (paste from Google)
   - Save
   ```

5. **Test Again!**
   - Go back to: http://localhost:3000/login
   - Click Google button
   - ✅ Redirects to Google login
   - ✅ Sign in with your account
   - ✅ Redirects back to your app
   - ✅ You're logged in!

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

Run through these to verify everything:

### Visual Tests:
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000/login
- [ ] See Google button with colors
- [ ] Button looks clickable (not grayed out)
- [ ] "Or continue with" divider shows

### Interaction Tests:
- [ ] Click Google button
- [ ] Spinner appears on button
- [ ] Button becomes disabled
- [ ] Error message shows (expected before OAuth setup)

### After OAuth Configuration:
- [ ] Click Google button
- [ ] Browser redirects to Google
- [ ] Sign in with Google account
- [ ] Redirect back to your app
- [ ] You're logged in!

### Database Tests (After Successful Login):
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.provider,
  p.full_name,
  p.avatar_url,
  p.subscription_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = u.id
WHERE u.provider = 'google'
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:** User with provider='google', profile auto-created

## 🔧 Callback URLs Reference

### For Google Console (Authorized Redirect URIs):
```
Production:
https://kgpctabhtsrrdyxetawz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

Development:
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

**Add BOTH to Google Console!**

### For Supabase (Callback URL):
```
https://kgpctabhtsrrdyxetawz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

**This is what Supabase gives you - copy it exactly to Google Console.**

## 🎨 What Working OAuth Looks Like

### Flow Diagram:
```
1. User at: http://localhost:3000/login
   Clicks: "Google" button
   ↓
2. Button shows: Spinner animation
   Button state: Disabled
   ↓
3. Browser redirects to: Google login page
   User sees: Google sign-in interface
   ↓
4. User signs in at Google
   Grants permissions
   ↓
5. Google redirects to: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   With: Authorization code
   ↓
6. Supabase processes: Callback
   Creates/updates: User in auth.users
   Trigger fires: handle_new_user()
   ↓
7. Profile created in: profiles table
   With: Name, avatar, email
   ↓
8. User redirected to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   ↓
9. ✅ User is logged in!
   Session: Active
   Profile: Loaded
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Error "Failed to sign in with google"

**Before OAuth configured:**
✅ This is EXPECTED! Configure OAuth first.

**After OAuth configured:**
1. Check Client ID and Secret are correct in Supabase
2. Check redirect URI matches exactly in Google Console
3. Check Google provider is enabled in Supabase
4. Clear browser cache and try again

---

### Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Fix:**
1. Go to Google Console → Credentials → Your OAuth Client
2. Check "Authorized redirect URIs"
3. Make sure you have:
   ```
   https://kgpctabhtsrrdyxetawz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```
4. Save and wait 5 minutes for changes to propagate
5. Try again

---

### Issue: Button doesn't show spinner

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Make sure React is rendering properly
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

### Issue: User signed in but no profile

**Check trigger:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

**If missing, recreate:**
```sql
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```
